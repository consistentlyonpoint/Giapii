				Backround Information: Intelligent Tutoring Systems
			</h2>
          	<h5 style=text-transform:none;color:black;font-weight:400;>
				Research for the efficacy of ITS as an educational tool has not been limited to the analysis of test scores. ITS developers have built ITS software 
				and proposed ITS methodologies which address learning styles, personality types, emotion, metacognitive change. From (Conati, 2009), a human or artificial 
				intelligent tutors must possess 3 knowledge bases: “(i) knowledge about the target instructional domain, (ii) knowledge about the student, and (iii) 
				knowledge about the relevant pedagogical strategies”. Conati defines a fourth knowledge field “communication knowledge”, meaning, how to present the 
				information. With domain and communication knowledge, an ITS can present information and problem statements to students according to the students’ abilities 
				and preferences. Researchers have worked on ITS which are capable of assessing and developing a students meta-cognitive ability. (Flavell 1976) defines 
				meta-cognition as “one’s knowledge concerning one’s own cognitive processes and products or anything related to them”. Within a students’ meta-cognitive 
				ability are their skills of self-monitoring, self-explanation, learning from example, and effective help seeking. The ACE (Adaptive Coach for Exploration) 
				ITS, which is used by students for mathematical functions, was developed from Conati to foster user exploration. ACE will respond to the students’ inputs 
				and intervene when an input is suboptimal. Advancements in the field of cognitive science offer approaches for ITS developers to best foster meta-cognitive skills.
				<br></br>
				The use of an ITS to improve a students’ meta-cognition was found to be a lasting benefit. (Roll et al, 2011) researched how an ITS can improve students’ 
				help-seeking abilities. Their research encompassed two studies which were designed to evaluate students’ behaviors with regard to help-seeking as a function of 
				“The Help Tutor”, an ITA (intelligent tutor agent). This ITA  was integrated into a commercial ITS for geometry, “Geometry Cognitive Tutor”. In the first study, 
				the researchers observed an improvement in the students’ desire to seek help, and  in the second study, they found that this behavior was transferable to study 
				areas in which the ITA was not implemented. The work of (Roll et al, 2006) / (Roll et al, 2011) expanded on the meta-cognitive impact of an ITS. The systems are 
				not only able to “tutor”, but through tutoring, they can enforce positive education habits, which  will serve students beyond a single course.
				<br></br>
				(Soudani et al, 2013) investigated ITS which adapted to the different learning styles of students and to the emotional state of students. They proposed the 
				ITS “PATS” (Personalized Affective Tutoring System) that tailor the users’ learning environment as a function of the users’ learning style and emotions. The results 
				of their research show a statistically significant improvement in the users’ average correct answers on tests and in the users’ satisfaction with the program when 
				comparing the PATS system with user modeling versus without user modeling.
				<br></br>
				Furthermore, (Niesler et al, 2009) researched evaluation of personality type in order to identify learning type. Users’ complete a questionnaire to determine their 
				personality type in the Myers-Briggs model. From these results, the researchers assign the MBTI characteristics to learning dimensions and define guidelines for 
				tutoring based on the assignment.
				<br></br>
				Beyond mapping Myers-Briggs to learning styles, (Latham et al, 2012) proposed a conversational ITS, Oscar, which would assess the user based on Felder’s Index of 
				Learning Styles model. The adaptive nature of the Oscar is focused on the tutoring conversation. During the conversation between the user and Oscar, Oscar 
				“dynamically predicts and adapts to a student’s learning style”.  Oscar is able to offer the learning material “sequence and style most suited to the individual’s 
				knowledge and learning style (curriculum sequencing), analyzing and giving feedback on incomplete and erroneous solutions (intelligent solution analysis) and giving 
				intelligent hints and discussing questions (problem solving support)” (Latham et al, 2012). For this study, 95% of participants found Oscar helpful and 89% felt Oscar 
				helped them in revision.
				<br></br>
				With technological advancements, all methods assessing student needs provided in a traditional classroom will be possible through an ITS. The students’ psychological 
				needs, such as the need for perceived support and feeling of autonomy in their education (Katz et al, 2010) & (Reeve et al, 2006), are evaluated in modern ITS, which 
				identify emotional state and meta-cognitive skills, such as self-monitoring, self-explanation, learning from example, and effective help seeking (Conati, 2009). 
				Though no research was included which compared students’ needs assessments conducted in a traditional classroom versus conducted via an ITS. The accuracy of both 
				approaches will be an important point of research. 
				<br></br>
				A future development of ITS could utilize the IEP approach for individualizing subject matter and goals for the students. Prior to use, parents and school 
				administrators could meet to establish the initial settings for an ITS. The ITS will further develop a learning model for the student, but the IEP would offer an 
				initial state for the ITS when interacting with the student, as well as parameters to prevent an ITS from deviating too far from these initial settings.
				<br></br>
				Another future for an ITS’s ability to assess students' needs could be a neural network of ITSs. This network would map the subject based ITS 
				(many commercial ITS are subject matter specific, i.e. Oscar -> SQL, Geometry Cognitive Tutor) together to best quantify the students’ meta-cognitivie skills, 
				their learning styles, and their emotional state. Through AI and conversation with the student, the network could assess the students’ needs and adapt the tutoring 
				approach in real-time
