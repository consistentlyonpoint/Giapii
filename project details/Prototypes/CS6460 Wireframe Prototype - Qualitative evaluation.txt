After more thought, I'm still not sure what the downward-point arrow does (does it change direction at all when clicked? The positioning over the boxes doesn't help) nor the home button (does it go back to the first page? the paginated view also somewhat suggests that even page 3 might just be part of a ""home"" page). The placement of ""search criterion"" also suggests that something should be underneath it like the other headings in the row."

For some reason I find this orange gradient a bit off-putting, but that's just my opinion."	"For the data gathering, I might make each symbol its own question. For example, I put agree for the ""three line menu"" and ""arrow"" icons because I'm confident I know what the menu is but I don't know what the arrow is. That is not expressed in my answer."

I would offer multiple feedback methods (e.g. symbols and words and hover feature, etc.). Also, the gradient symbol to the right of school, option, grade, etc. does not make sense to me. Is this a sort button? If it is, I would use the base-feature sort arrows that are more common excel/sheets. "	"I selected the comment bubble because it seemed to be the most intuitive for that feature of the options listed. However, it would be even more intuitive (to me at least) to either have a question mark pop up or to simply have the bubble display the description immediately when hovering over the word. "
