## Guidelines for Individualized Academic Planning and ITS Implementation for K-12 Students: a Resource Guide

[GIAPPI Project Site](https://giappi-k12.b4a.app)

### Abstract
Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and Individualized
Education Plans (IEPs) have existed for decades in education.
Researchers, through meta-analyses, have demonstrated the
efficacy of ITS(s), irrespective of field of study (technical and
non-technical subjects) in K-12 education (Ma et al, 2014). Modern
ITS are capable of evaluating and identifying a student’s
emotional state and meta-cognitive skills, such as self-monitoring,
self-explanation, etc (Conati, 2009). Since the 1970s, IEPs are, by
law, implemented for students which are covered by IDEA
(Individuals with Disabilities Education Act). An IEP is
constructed annually by educators, administrators, and parents of
special education students to define specific academic and
functional goals per student. Building on existing research and
education practice, this project will deliver a resource for any
individual constructing a curriculum for a K-12 student, looking
to implement ITS(s) within a field of study. The resource will be a
web-based interface (website) for parents/tutors/teachers and
students to provide: (1) a background on IEP history and usage;
(2) guidelines for planning a student’s curriculum with ITS(s)
implemented; (3) a repository and search tool for commercially
available ITS.
